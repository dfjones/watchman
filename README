Simple utility that watches files/directories for changes and performs an action when they change. Inspired (and partially based on) the coffee-script compiler.

I'm sure this is reinventing 100 other, better tools.

Yes I wrote it in coffee-script and NodeJS. Does that make me hip now?

Examples:

./watchman watchman "ls -lah"
watching: watchman
File changed: watchman

-rwxr-xr-x   1 doug  doug   1.2K Mar 10 23:27 watchman

Works with directories
./watchman test "echo 'hello world'"
watching: test/bar
watching: test/foo
File changed: test/foo

hello world
